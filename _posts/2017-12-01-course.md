Jennifer Webster and Ruth Anderson will offer a graduate course,  CSE 599, Gender in ICTD &amp; HCI Research Winter 2018.  THe course meets Monday and Wednesdays 3:30-4:50 pm.

This graduate seminar explores the topic of gender as related to computer science research, especially in the fields of Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Students will engage in close readings of foundational texts on gender, as well as the emerging ICTD and HCI literature that uses gender analysis as a framework for research in both the West and in resource-constrained regions of the world. Through discussion and written assignments students will build a strong foundation for incorporating gender analysis into their research. They will also be able to more effectively evaluate the current work being conducted in the fields of ICTD and HCI as related to gender. Some of the topics under consideration will include gender as related to feminist HCI, design, health and safety, financial services, and mobile technologies and connectivity.
