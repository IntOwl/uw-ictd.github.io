Many Government and Non-Government Organizations are looking to using state of the art systems developing regions. The main challenge for them is that they don't want to invest much in IT support. We build systems with the intelligent configuration so they are drop n deploy ready. The goal is to have as little training as possible and expect user to be semi-literate. This posses some challenges when the underderline system might be running complicated distibuted database or a network layer.

Our [Open Data Kit (ODK)][ODK] application suite has an underlying database and cross application communication handles data input from various system, some user entered and some from sensors.
