### Digital Financial Services

The University of Washington has established the [Digital Financial Services Research Group][http://dfs.cs.washington.edu/] to investigate technologies that will improve the ability of banks and mobile operators to deploy Digital Financial Service (DFS) products that reach the poor. The goal is to develop and deploy technological solutions to specific challenges that impede the introductions and wide scale deployment of these financial products. Low profitability, lack of client demand, and the outright failure of many DFS launches can be traced back to difficult barriers and frictions that hinder the business model and scalability of DFS systems. Many of these barriers and frictions could be addressed by high potential emerging technologies but often the requisite translation of these technologies from the lab or from other sectors into usable tools is not happening with the necessary urgency.
