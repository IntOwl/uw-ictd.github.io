Our research focuses on how technology can improve the lives of underserved populations in low-income regions. Our research has wide range of themes. The *HCI* theme addresses challenges in interfaces for low literate people, even for basic technologies like SMS or voice calls. The *system* theme explores how complicated systems can be built with the assumption that user has less or no IT support. The *networks and communication* theme focuses on building systems or applications that connects people in rural areas that has little or no connectivity available. The *security* theme looks at all possible threats that current systems in low resource area are exposed to and how to handle those threats. The *behavior change communication* theme explores how technology can educate and introduce best practices among people in slums and/or rural parts of the world. The *global health* theme looks at applications that supports analysis, interfaces and education for better health care in developing region. The *Data Analytics* theme aims to provide support for data cleaning, understanding the data and running complex analysis for users with little knowledge about the data or the analytics process.
