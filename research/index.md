Our research focuses on how technology can improve the lives of underserved populations in low-income regions. Our research has wide range of themes. The *HCI* theme addresses challenges in interfaces for low literate people, even for basic technologies like SMS or voice calls. The *system* theme explores how complicated systems can be built with the assumption that user has less or no IT support. The *networks and communication* theme focuses on building systems or applications that connects people in rural areas that has little or no connectivity available. The *security* theme looks at all possible threats that current systems in low resource area are exposed to and how to handle those threats. The *behavior change communication* theme explores how technology can educate and introduce best practices among people in slums and/or rural parts of the world. The *global health* theme looks at applications that supports analysis, interfaces and education for better health care in developing region. The *Data Analytics* theme aims to provide support for data cleaning, understanding the data and running complex analysis for users with little knowledge about the data or the analytics process.



### Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

There are serveral challenges when designing systems for low literate people. Langguage and literacy are the biggest challenges when designing systems. Our [SMS system](sms.html) and [IVR system](ivr.html) tackles this problem.


### Systems

Many Government and Non-Government Organizations are looking to using state of the art systems developing regions. The main challenge for them is that they don't want to invest much in IT support. We build systems with the intelligent configuration so they are drop n deploy ready. The goal is to have as little training as possible and expect user to be semi-literate. This posses some challenges when the underderline system might be running complicated distibuted database or a network layer.

Our [Open Data Kit (ODK)][ODK] application suite has an underlying database and cross application communication handles data input from various system, some user entered and some from sensors.

### Networks and Communication

Focuses on building systems or applications that connects people in rural areas that has little or no connectivity available.

### Security

Explore possible threats that current systems in low resource area are exposed to and how to handle those threats.

### Behavior Change Communication

Explores how technology can educate and introduce best practices among people in slums and/or rural parts of the world.

### Global Health

Looks at applications that supports analysis, interfaces and education for better health care in developing region.

### Data Analytics

Aims to provide support for data cleaning, understanding the data and running complex analysis for users with little knowledge about the data or the analytics process.
