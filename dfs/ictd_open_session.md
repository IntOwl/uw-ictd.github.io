### Developing an ICTD Research Agenda for Digital Financial Services

#### Sunday,  June 5, 2:30-4:00pm, Vandenberg Room, 2nd floor
 
Increasing access to Digital Financial Services can have a dramatic impact in reducing global poverty.  However, many challenges have been identified in the introduction of Digital Financial Services including improving proximity payments, reducing the vulnerability of transactions to cyberattacks, and developing analytics to improve management of agent networks.  This session aims to bring together ICTD researchers interested in developing a research agenda in Digital Financial Services.

#### Structure

The open session will be a moderated panel session.  During the first 60 minutes, the panelists will present their views on research on Digital Financial Services,  beginning with brief presentations, and followed by round robin questions from the moderator.  The final thirty minutes be open questions from the audience to the panelists.
