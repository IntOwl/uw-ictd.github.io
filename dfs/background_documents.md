The literature on Digital Financial Services spans multiple academic disciplines as well as many research and consulting organizations.  We list a few works here that we have found useful in beginning to work in the area.


We have recently completed a review of the Computer Science literature to identify papers related to Digital Financial Services.  The paper is the first [Research Note][UWDFS001] of the DFS group!
