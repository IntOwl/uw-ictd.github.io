title: Background Documents on Digital Financial Services
---

The literature on Digital Financial Services spans multiple academic disciplines as well as many research and consulting organizations.  We list a few works here that we have found useful in beginning to work in the area.

* M-Pesa has been one of the success stories for mobile money.  This 2009 [paper][Mas2009] by Ignacio Mas and Olga Morawczynski discusses the early history of M-Pesa.
* CGAP is an independent policy and research center that publishes a wide range of reports on financial access for the world's poor.  The report[CGAP_DDFR] Doing Digital Finance Right: The Case for Stronger Mitigation of Customer Risks  presents an analysis of challenges from the customer perspective.

We have recently completed a review of the Computer Science literature to identify papers related to Digital Financial Services.  The paper is the first [Research Note][UWDFS001] of the DFS group!
