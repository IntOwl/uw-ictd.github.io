[Undergraduate reading seminar, Technology for the Developing World - Digital Financial Services, CSE490D:](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/490D/)
This winter quarter we are offering a 1-credit, undergraduate reading seminar on technology in the developing world, with an emphasis on digital financial services.   The purpose of the seminar is to provide an introduction to a research area at the intersection of computer science and global development.  One of the mechanisms to bring people out of poverty is to increase access to financial services, including mobile money and savings instruments.  To accomplish this, it is necessary to utilize multiple technologies that can be deployed in resource constrained environments.  Winter 2016, Wednesdays, 4:30-5:20 PM.

\(Last offered, Spring 2014\) CSE 490D/481K is a two-quarter-long design and implementation sequence. In winter, students form project groups to scope and design projects for resource-constrained environments. In the spring quarter students implement and evaluate the projects that were started in the winter. The emphasis is on group work leading to the creation of testable realizations and completion of initial evaluations of the software and hardware artifacts produced. Students work in with a faculty or graduate student manager.
